## Setting up your own high-performance WordPress hosting

This presentation is for the [SF WordPress Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/wordpress-sf/events/62877782/).  It's based on a [blog post](http://evansolomon.me/notes/faster-wordpress-multisite-nginx-batcache/) I wrote on setting up a high-performance WordPress server.

It will cover the most important topics (in my opinion) of setting up your WordPress host:

* Setting up a VPS
* Navigating Linux
* PHP-FPM
* nginx
* MySQL
* Sending email from a server
* Installing WordPress
* Configuring WordPress Multisite
* Caching with Batcache
* Measuring your host's performance


## Why is it here?

I'm posting it on Github because I've seen it work well for other presetnations, and because it seems like a fun and easy way to make it available.
